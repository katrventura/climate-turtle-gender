# Feminine Waves: How the Warming Climate Affects the Sex of Sea Turtle Hatchlings ð“†‰ 

## Overview

During the winter break, I embarked on a journey to Bataan, Philippines, and volunteered at the Pag-asa Pawikan Protection and Conservation Center. This experience fueled my passion for marine conservation, leading to the creation of "Feminine Waves." This data story focuses on the impact of warming climates on the sex of sea turtle hatchlings.

## Project Goals

The primary objective was to create a comprehensive data story featuring graphs and visualizations about the critical issue of sea turtle conservation. Inspired by my personal experience releasing a critically endangered hawksbill  sea turtle hatchling that I named "Malaya," I aimed to shed light on the challenges faced by critically sea turtles due to climate change.

## Findings

The data story unfolds with a map showcasing turtle nesting sites worldwide, coupled with data on rising ocean temperatures in the Asian and Pacific region. Extensive research was sited with regards to the correlation between warmer sands and an increase in female sea turtle hatchlings. The findings highlight the urgent need for conservation efforts to address the impact of climate change on sea turtle populations.

## Data Collection

### The State of the World's Sea Turtles:
Main database providing information on sea turtle nesting activities contributed by over 600 contributors from 130 countries. https://www.seaturtlestatus.org/online-map-data

### National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA):
Annual 2023 Global Climate Report revealed a 2.12Â°F (1.18Â°C) temperature anomaly above the 20th-century average.

## Data Analysis
Temperature anomaly data from NOAA was converted to actual temperatures with respect to the 1901-2000 average. Using mapping tools such as Mapbox and DataWrapper, along with Pandas Altair Vega for graph plotting, temperatures in different nesting locations were analyzed. The goal was to estimate the land and ocean average around the sea turtle nesting season.

## Skill Development

Throughout the project, I honed my skills in:

* Utilizing mapping tools such as Mapbox and DataWrapper.
* Employing Pandas Altair Vega for insightful graph visualizations.
* Creating an interactive and engaging article website to present the data story effectively.
* Challenges and Future Plans

## Challenges
Despite multiple attempts, creating a map with two layers â€“ data points of nesting locations and a heat map from NOAA â€“ proved challenging due to incomplete decimal units in NOAA's coordinates. With more time and refined skills, this feature can be revisited to enhance the visual storytelling aspect of the project.
